My career goal is becoming a front-end developer due to my interest in designing visually pleasant and convenient work with digital focuses. I also love the process of taking the ideas and designs and transforming that into an interactive web site that works not only well but also on any device. I find front-end development so appealing as it combines imagination with troubleshooting- enabling me to exercise my artistic taste and employ the technical competencies of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The moment when I see my work brought to life ever so slightly in real time but knowing that it may affect the user experience on how they engage a product encourages me to continue learning more and to keep improving. It is a constantly moving field, and I would like to develop along with it, creating projects that would leave a positive mark on the user.
